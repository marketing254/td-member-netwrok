 * Member view of the expert network feed.
 *
 * Notes on "Ask AI":
 *   The Ask-AI affordance still shows on each post in the feed itself
 *   (NetworkFeed.tsx) but is disabled with a "Soon" pill — the LLM-backed
 *   chat helper isn't shipping in this release. When it does ship, pass
 *   `onAskExpertBot` back to <NetworkFeed> here and re-mount the dialog;
 *   the rest of the infra (ExpertChatDialog, /api/network/experts/[id]/chat)
 *   is already in place.
