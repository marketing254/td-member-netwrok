-- DMN — Job board phase 2: applications, free job-seeker accounts,
--       and banner posts.
-- Run AFTER 0062_job_board_rls_hardening.sql.
-- Paste into Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor → New query → Run.
--
-- WHAT CHANGED AND WHY (this reverses part of the phase-1 spec, on
-- purpose — see the 1 Sep huddle):
--
--   Phase 1 said "applications go straight to the practice, we do not
--   sit in the middle", and listed candidate accounts + resume uploads
--   as explicitly NOT in scope. That has been overturned by the product
--   owner for one reason: an applicant who mailtos the practice is a
--   visitor we never see again. Requiring a FREE account before applying
--   converts that anonymous traffic into a contactable list, which is
--   the whole marketing argument for the board.
--
--   Browsing stays public and applying stays free. The paywall did not
--   move — a job seeker is never asked for $49.
--
-- THREE THINGS THIS FILE ADDS:
--   1. members.account_type — the discriminator that keeps a free
--      applicant out of every paid member surface. Read §1, it is the
--      load-bearing part of this migration.
--   2. job_applications — the stored application, its CV, and the
--      status the practice sets on it.
--   3. job_posts.post_format + banner columns — the "upload a banner
--      instead of typing a description" path.
-- =====================================================================

-- =====================================================================
-- 1. members.account_type — the free tier discriminator
--
-- Job seekers reuse public.members rather than getting their own table.
-- That was a deliberate product call, and it has one sharp edge that
-- this column exists to blunt:
--
--   requireMember() in src/lib/auth/guards.ts admits any row with
--   status = 'active'. A job seeker MUST be status='active' for the
--   OTP login to work at all. Without a second discriminator, every
--   free applicant would satisfy the member gate the moment they
--   registered.
--
-- So: account_type is checked in the guards alongside status, and the
-- admin member lists/counts filter on it. subscription_status stays
-- null for job seekers, so requirePaidMember() already rejects them
-- (402) — this column closes the *unpaid-but-active* member surfaces
-- that requirePaidMember doesn't cover.
--
-- Default 'member' means every existing row keeps its current meaning
-- and no existing query changes behaviour on day one.
-- =====================================================================

--
-- 0002 defined this as check (user_type in ('vendor','member','admin')).
-- The expert portal has been writing 'expert' since it shipped, and the
-- job-seeker routes added here write 'job_seeker'.
--
-- Every one of those inserts is wrapped in a best-effort try/catch, so
-- the constraint violation is swallowed and the audit row is simply
-- never written. That is the worst failure mode an audit trail can
-- have: it looks like it is working and it is quietly dropping the
-- events you would most want during an incident. Widening the check
-- fixes the expert rows too, which is a pre-existing bug this migration
-- happens to be the right place to close.

-- 2. job_posts — banner posts
--
-- A member can now post one of two ways:
--
--   'detailed' — the original form. Long rich-text description.
--   'banner'   — they generate a graphic (ChatGPT or anything else),
--                upload it, and fill in a short summary instead of the
--                long description.
--
-- THE SEO RULE THIS ENCODES: `description` stays NOT NULL with the same
-- 30-character floor for BOTH formats. That is not an oversight, it is
-- the point. An image carries no text Google can read, so a banner-only
-- post would be invisible to search and to the JobPosting structured
-- data — which is the single highest-value thing on the public page.
-- The banner replaces the *long* description, never the text itself.
--
-- Pay range also stays required for banner posts. It is the board's
-- clearest differentiator and it is enforced in the schema precisely so
-- that no new posting path can quietly drop it.
-- =====================================================================

  -- the storage origin can change without a data migration.

  -- Alt text is required for a banner post. Two reasons, both real:
  -- a screen reader user gets nothing from the image otherwise, and it
  -- is one more piece of indexable text on a page whose main content is
  -- a picture.

--
-- One row per (job post, applicant). The applicant must hold a free

--
-- The contact fields are copied onto the row rather than joined from

-- needs to see what was actually sent to them, not what the profile
