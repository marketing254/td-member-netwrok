/**
 * POST /api/seeker/signup
 *
 * Free account for a job seeker. This is the change the 1 Sep huddle
 * asked for: an applicant used to mailto the practice and vanish, and
 * now they register first so we hold a contactable record.
 *
 * FREE. There is no plan picker, no Stripe, no checkout cookie, and no
 * path from here to a payment page. If that ever changes it should be a
 * product decision made out loud, not a quiet edit to this file.
 *
 * How it differs from /api/member/signup, which it otherwise resembles:
 *
 *   - account_type = 'job_seeker'. This is the load-bearing field. It is
 *     what keeps the row out of every member surface (see requireMember
 *     in src/lib/auth/guards.ts and §1 of migration 0060).
 *   - tier stays null. Tier means a paid tier.
 *   - There is no checkout step in between. Member signup is pay-first
 *     and routes to the plan picker; this one goes straight to sign-in,
 *     because there is nothing to pay for.
 *
 * An email that already belongs to a PAYING member is refused rather
 * than converted — downgrading a subscriber's row because they clicked
 * the wrong form would be a genuinely bad outcome, and they can already
 * apply with the account they have.
