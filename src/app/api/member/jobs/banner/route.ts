/**
 * POST /api/member/jobs/banner
 *
 * Upload a job banner and get back its storage path. Separate from the
 * post itself because the member uploads before the post exists — they
 * are still filling the form — and because a failed image upload should
 * never cost them the text they have already typed.
 *
 * requirePaidMember, same as posting: the banner is part of a job ad,
 * and job ads are the members-only half of the board.
 *
 * The returned value is a PATH, not a URL. The caller stores it on
 * job_posts.banner_path and the public page resolves it through
 * bannerPublicUrl(), so the storage origin can move without a data
 * migration.
