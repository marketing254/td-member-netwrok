 * Records one view of a job page.

 * "Views per post matters more than it sounds. It is the only evidence
 * we can give a member that posting here did anything." So it has to be
 * a number the member trusts, which means it should count people rather
 * than requests.
 *
 * Fired from the client on purpose: counting server renders would fold
 * in every crawler, preview fetch and uptime check, and inflate the one
 * number we're asking a member to believe. Deduplication per viewer per
 * day happens server-side on a unique index.
 *
 * Renders nothing and never blocks paint.
