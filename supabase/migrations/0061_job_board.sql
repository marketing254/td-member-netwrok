-- DMN — Job board (phase 1)
-- Run AFTER 0060_job_board_reset.sql.
-- Paste into Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor → New query → Run.
--
-- The product is the PROMOTION, not the board. That shapes the schema:
--   - job_posts        : the vacancy itself, plus its promotion state
--   - job_post_views   : one row per view, the only evidence we can give
--                        a member that posting here did anything
--
-- Two rules from the spec are enforced in the DB, not just the UI, so a
-- bad API call can't get around them:
--   1. Pay range is REQUIRED. pay_min/pay_max/pay_unit are all NOT NULL.
--   2. Nothing is public without a human approving it — `live` is only
--      reachable by an admin setting approved_at + reviewed_by.
--
-- Browsing is public and posting is members-only, so unlike the rest of
-- the schema this table grants SELECT to `anon` — but only for rows that
-- are actually live (see the RLS policy). Everything else goes through
-- service-role API routes.

-- Row Level Security
--
-- This is the one table in the schema anon can read. Browsing is public
-- by design — job seekers will never pay to look for a job, and a board
-- with no candidates gets no applicants, which kills the feature. The
-- policy is narrow: live rows only, nothing in draft/pending/rejected.
--
-- THE RULE THIS SECTION EXISTS TO PROTECT: nothing appears publicly
-- without a human approving it. That is a spec decision marked "not
-- optional", so it is held in THREE places, not one:
--
--   1. No UPDATE grant to anon or authenticated at all (below). Every
--      member write goes through a service-role API route, so a member
--      holding the public anon key and their own JWT has no PostgREST
--      write path to their row.
--   2. A BEFORE UPDATE trigger that refuses to let the anon/authenticated
--      roles touch the approval, promotion or metric columns even if
--      somebody re-adds a permissive UPDATE policy later.
--   3. The job_posts_live_needs_approval CHECK constraint, which stops
--      a row reaching `live` without approved_at + expires_at.
--
-- An earlier draft of this file granted `update` on the whole table to
-- `authenticated` with a row-level-only policy. That let a member PATCH
-- their own row directly through PostgREST and set status='live',
-- approved_at=now(), expires_at=now()+30d — self-publishing straight
-- past the review queue, and also faking promoted_* and view_count.
-- Do not reintroduce it.
