-- Creates a public storage bucket `vendor-logos`, with policies that let
-- each vendor upload/replace/delete files keyed by their own vendor_id.
-- Files are publicly readable (logos are shown in the member directory
-- and inside the vendor's own portal).
-- =====================================================================

-- Create the bucket if it doesn't exist. Public = true means anonymous
-- HTTPS GETs are allowed (good — logos are public branding assets).
