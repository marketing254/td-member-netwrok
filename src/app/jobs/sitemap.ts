/**
 * /jobs/sitemap.xml — every live job page.
 *
 * Separate from the static app/sitemap.ts because these URLs are
 * generated, short-lived (30 days) and need real `lastModified` values.
 * Getting a new posting crawled quickly is most of the value of the
 * JobPosting markup; a sitemap that only refreshes on deploy would sit
 * on a new job for days.
 *
 * Only `live` posts are listed. Filled and expired pages stay reachable
 * but drop out of the sitemap, which is the signal we want: don't keep
 * pushing Google at a job nobody can apply for.
