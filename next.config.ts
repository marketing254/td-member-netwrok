 * Minimal Next.js config — security headers moved to middleware.ts
 * because Vercel's modifyConfig step on Next.js 16.2.x was choking on
 * the headers() function. Middleware applies the same headers at request
 * time, with the bonus that they're testable and easier to evolve.
 *
 * `compiler.removeConsole` strips every `console.*` call from client-
 * bundled code in production builds — except `console.error`, which
 * we keep for diagnostic logging that surfaces in browser dev tools but
 * never leaks PII (we route detailed errors through server logs via the
 * lib/api/errorResponse helper).
 *
 * Server-side console.log is untouched — server logs stay on the
 * platform (Vercel logs / your hosting provider) and never reach the
 * end user's browser.
