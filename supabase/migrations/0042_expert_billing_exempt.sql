-- =====================================================================
-- DMN — Founding experts are billing-exempt (lifetime free)
-- Run after 0041_founding_invite_companies.sql.
--
-- Policy: the founding cohort of experts (first 20 REAL experts, test /
-- internal accounts excluded) is entirely free for life. We never ask
-- them for a card and never create a Stripe subscription for them.
--
-- IMPORTANT — this is expert-side only. Companies (vendors) are still
-- charged on the normal 3-phase ladder. A person who is BOTH an expert
-- and a company keeps paying through their `vendors` row; only their
-- `experts` row is exempt.
--
-- Why an explicit flag instead of "first 20 by created_at": the cohort
-- has to skip test rows, and ordering shifts as rows are added/deleted.
-- A flag is auditable and can't silently re-rank.
