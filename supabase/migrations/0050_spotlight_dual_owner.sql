-- DMN — Spotlights can belong to an expert AND a partner (Phase: Pearl+)
-- Run after 0049_inquiry_pack_delivery.sql.
--
-- When an expert and a partner company are related (e.g. an expert who
-- teaches under a partner brand), one spotlight should surface on BOTH
-- profiles. Relax the one-owner XOR to "one or two owners". The feed
-- nudge still credits a single author (expert preferred) because
-- expert_posts keeps its exactly-one-author constraint.
