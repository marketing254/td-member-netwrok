-- =====================================================================
-- DMN — Cap the lifetime-free founding-expert cohort at 20
-- Run after 0042_expert_billing_exempt.sql.
--
-- Policy: the FIRST 20 real experts are free for life. Expert 21 onward
-- goes on the normal paid ladder ($0 months 1-6 → $49 months 7-12 →
-- $199 month 13+), exactly like partners.
--
-- Enforced in the DATABASE rather than in app code because the flag can
-- be set from several places (the repair script, the admin console, a
-- future onboarding step). A trigger is the only spot that all of them
-- must pass through, so the 21st expert cannot be made free by accident.
--
-- Mirrors the spirit of FOUNDING_MEMBER_CAP (100) for members: the cap
-- counts LIFETIME grants — revoking is already blocked by 0042's guard,
-- so a freed seat can never be recycled.
