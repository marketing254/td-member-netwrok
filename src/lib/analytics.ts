/**
 * GA4 event helper — the missing half of our analytics.
 *
 * GoogleAnalytics.tsx loads gtag and tracks page views; until now NO
 * conversion events existed anywhere, so every GA4 report showed
 * "Key events: 0" and landing-page analysis was impossible.
 *
 * Funnel events (mark each as a KEY EVENT in GA4 Admin → Events):
 *   sign_up         — a member account was created (params.method says
 *                     which flow: organic | referral | meta_ads)
 *   begin_checkout  — a Stripe checkout was opened
 *   purchase        — a membership subscription was confirmed
 *
 * Rules:
 *   - Silent no-op when gtag isn't loaded (dev, preview, blockers).
 *   - Never throws — analytics must never break a signup or payment.
 *   - No PII in params (GA4 policy + our own).
