/**
 * /join — public member signup form.
 *
 * What it does:
 *   1. Visitor fills the form (name, email, practice, role, etc.).
 *   2. Form posts to /api/waitlist → writes a `waitlist_signups` row
 *      (NOT a `members` row — they don't get portal access yet).
 *   3. Visitor lands on /waitlist/thanks for the confirmation copy.
 *   4. Admin sees them in /admin/waitlist, reviews, and clicks Activate.
 *   5. Activate creates the `members` row + auth user + welcome email.
 *   6. Visitor receives the welcome email → /member/login → /upgrade →
 *      Stripe checkout → /dashboard.
 *
 * This page is the entry-point for everyone clicking "Join" / "Become a
 * member" / "Claim your founding seat" across the site. The form is
 * reused from WaitlistSection with lockedRole="member" so we don't
 * maintain two copies of the same fields + validation.
 *
 * Query params (optional, preserved by upstream CTAs):
 *   ?intent=founding|early|standard  — which plan they expressed interest in
 *   ?interval=monthly|annual         — billing cadence they picked on /pricing
 *
 * These are informational only at the signup stage — the actual price
 * choice is made at checkout, after admin activation. They're surfaced
 * here so the team can prioritise applicants by tier intent if needed.
