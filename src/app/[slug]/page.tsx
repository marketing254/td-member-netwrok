 * Root-level referral vanity handles — e.g. dentalmembernetwork.com/drparul

 * Next.js matches every real page (/experts, /pricing, /join, …) by its own
 * static segment first, so this catch-all only ever sees genuinely-unknown
 * single-segment paths. If the path is a known referral handle we redirect
 * to the normal signup with the code attached (?ref=CODE), which reuses all
 * the existing capture + attribution logic. Anything else 404s.
 *
 * A tiny reserved-word guard short-circuits obvious non-handles so they 404
 * without a DB round-trip.
