-- DMN — Kit access counts (dashboard "Top 5")
-- Run after 0052_billing_hardening.sql.
--
-- Aggregates member_resource_progress into per-kit open counts so the
-- member dashboard's "Top 5 in the network" ranks by real usage without
-- the API scanning the whole progress table on every page load.
-- Exposes aggregate numbers only — no member ids.
