-- =====================================================================
-- DMN — Member promotional codes (3-month free trial)
-- Run after 0053_kit_access_counts.sql.
--
-- Every expert and partner gets a promo code. Naming:
--   expert only          → first name          (MARY)
--   partner only         → company word        (COOP)
--   expert + partner     → one combined code   (MARY-COOP), with BOTH
--                          expert_id and vendor_id set so it shows in
--                          both of their portals.
-- When the team ACTIVATES a code, a joining member who enters it at the
-- payment step still adds their card, but gets a 3-month (90-day)
-- Stripe trial before the first charge. Deactivating a code makes it
-- unusable at checkout immediately.
--
-- Codes are auto-ensured for existing + future experts/partners by the
-- admin "Promo codes" console (GET /api/admin/promo-codes sweeps and
-- creates any that are missing). Team-owned codes (no expert/vendor,
-- e.g. LESTER) are seeded here / created from the console.
