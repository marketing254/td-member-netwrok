 * Validator for a job application.

 * path, mirroring the CHECK constraints in 0063_job_applications.sql. The
 * DB is the real guarantee; this exists so the applicant gets a sentence
 * they can act on instead of a Postgres constraint name.
 *
 * Note what is NOT validated here: the CV file itself. A File/Blob can't
 * be checked in a shared module that both the browser form and the route
 * import, so validateCvFile() below takes the already-extracted name/size/type
 * and is called from both sides.
