/**
 * /start — the dedicated Meta paid-ads purchase page.
 *
 * Fully static: no DB reads, no dynamic APIs — campaign parameters
 * (?creative=, utm_*, fbclid) are read client-side, so every ad click is
 * served straight from the CDN edge cache regardless of query string.
 * An ad traffic spike therefore cannot touch the database at all until
 * a buyer actually submits the form.
 *
 * noindex: this is a paid-traffic conversion page, not organic content —
 * keeping it out of Google avoids duplicate-content competition with the
 * main homepage. (The Meta ad crawler does not require indexability.)
