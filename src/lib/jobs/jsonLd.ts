/**
 * schema.org JobPosting markup — the reason a member's vacancy shows up
 * in Google for Jobs rather than only on our own board.
 *
 * The spec calls this "the single highest value hour of work in the
 * build", and it earns that by being free distribution on top of the
 * group: every approved post becomes an entry in the biggest job search
 * surface there is, at no marginal cost to us.
 *
 * Google's required properties are title, description, datePosted,
 * hiringOrganization and jobLocation (or jobLocationType for remote).
 * validThrough is strongly recommended and we always have it, because
 * every post carries a 30-day expiry. Omitting it is what makes boards
 * accumulate stale listings in Google long after they're dead.
 *
 * Two deliberate choices:
 *  - hiringOrganization is the PRACTICE, not DMN. Google wants the
 *    employer; naming ourselves would be misrepresentation and gets
 *    postings dropped.
 *  - directApply is false. Applications go to the practice by email or
 *    their own link — a seeker cannot complete an application on our
 *    page, and claiming otherwise is exactly what Google penalises.
